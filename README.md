# TransferLearning_and_CMAP
This repository includes two jupyter notebooks. The first one retrains the already pre-trained ResNet-50 using transfer learning in order to classify fruits from the Kaggle 360 Fruits challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). The architecute will be adapted in order to compute the class activation maps within the second notebook.
